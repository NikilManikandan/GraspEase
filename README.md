# GraspEase
An Indigenous, Low-Cost Active Wrist-Hand Orthosis for Rehabilitation

# Affordable Wrist–Hand Orthosis for Functional Grasp + Rehab

## Overview
This project aims to develop an **affordable, user-centric wrist–hand orthosis** that helps users **restore functional grasp, hold, and release** while also **promoting rehabilitation and independence**. The solution is designed to be **accessible**, **scalable**, and **cost-effective**—positioning it as an alternative to high-cost robotic rehabilitation systems.

---

## Key Goals
- Enable **functional hand actions**: *grasp → hold → release*
- Support **rehabilitation** through structured therapy and progress tracking
- Provide **multi-modal control** so users with different mobility levels can operate the device comfortably
- Deliver a **cross-platform, user-friendly app experience**
- Improve accessibility using **hands-free interaction** where needed

---

## Multi-Control Access
To accommodate users with varying motor abilities, the orthosis supports multiple control inputs:

- **Switch control**
- **Joystick control**
- **Tilt/IMU-based control**
- **Foot pedal control**
- **App-based control**

This approach ensures the system can be configured for **individual needs**, improving usability and independence.

---

## Application Layer (Flutter + Google Technologies)
The system includes a **Flutter-based application** that provides a smooth **cross-platform interface** (Android/iOS-ready and extensible). The app is designed to be intuitive for daily use while supporting rehabilitation workflows.

### AI-Enabled Motion Visualization
The application supports **AI-enabled motion visualization** for:
- **Real-time tracking of hand movement**
- Monitoring **rehabilitation progress**
- Enabling data-driven feedback for therapy improvement

---

## Speech-to-Text (Hands-Free Control)
The system integrates **Speech-to-Text** functionality to allow **hands-free control**, especially beneficial for users with severe motor limitations. This reduces reliance on physical inputs and improves overall accessibility.

---

## Rehabilitation + Therapy Modes
To encourage consistent use and measurable recovery, the orthosis includes:

- **Rehabilitation modes** for guided training
- **Gamified therapy modes** to improve engagement, motivation, and adherence

These modes are designed to make therapy more interactive while supporting long-term improvement.

---

## Why This Matters
Many existing robotic rehabilitation systems are effective but often **expensive and inaccessible**. This project focuses on delivering a solution that is:

- **Affordable**
- **User-centric**
- **Intelligent**
- **Accessible**
- **Rehab-oriented**
- **Scalable for broader adoption**

---
